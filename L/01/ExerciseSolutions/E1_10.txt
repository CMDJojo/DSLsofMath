-- Exercise 1_EmbedEval

When is embed (eval e) == e


Step 0: type the quantification, what is the type of e?

eval  :: Syn -> Sem
embed :: Sem -> Syn
e :: Syn


Step 1: what equality is suitable for this type?

Simplifications are not taken into account in the syntax. Same semantics can have different syntaxes. For example 3 + 7 != 10 in syntax. Thus the equality holds if e is already simplified.


Step 2: if you use "equality up to eval" - how is the resulting property related to the first round-trip property?

equalityUpTo f x y =   (f x) == (f y)
Typical example: equality up to (mod n) means equality modulo n
9 and 5 are equal modulo 4 but are not equal numbers

equalityUpTo eval a b = (eval a) == (eval b)
a and b can be equal up to eval even if they are not equal as syntactic expressions

Calculation:

  let (===) = equalityUpTo eval in  embed (eval e) === e
= {- Def. of (===) -}
  equalityUpTo eval (embed (eval e)) e
= {- Def. of equalityUpTo -}
  eval (embed (eval e)) == eval e
= {- First round-trip property: eval (embed s) = s -}
  eval e == eval e
= {- Simplify -}
  True

Thus, if we look at "equality up to eval", embed (eval e) is "equal" to e.
