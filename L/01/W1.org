** Examination
+ *2 Assignments (labs)* -> Pass/fail grade
+ *Written Exam*         -> grade U/3/4/5 (Chalmers), U/G/VG (GU)
+ Weekly exercises     -> Bonus points for the exam
** Reminder about spending time on the course:
+ Advice from last years' students:
  spending time on the course pays off.
  It is not enough to just focus on the labs.
+ Patrik's advice: please try to solve all the exercises in the book.
** Course evaluation: student representatives

** Learning outcomes (for the whole course, english version)
*** KU = Knowledge and Understanding
+ KU.DSL      = design and implement a DSL for a new domain
+ KU.Org      = organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
+ KU.Explain  = explain main concepts of elementary real and complex analysis, algebra, and linear algebra
*** SA = Skills and Abilities
+ SA.Notation = develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
+ SA.Calc     = perform calculational proofs
+ SA.Power    = use power series for solving differential equations
+ SA.Laplace  = use Laplace transforms for solving differential equations
*** JA = Judgement and Approach
+ JA = discuss and compare different software implementations of mathematical concepts
** First break-out rooms to start the discussion [10min]
+ brief presentation round
+ share examples of confusing notation in mathematics cmp. to programming
  d/dx??
  integral
  geometry / algebra
* L1.1 learning outcomes:
** What is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
A DSL has four components:
+ Surface syntax (mostly ignored in this course): a set of strings defined by a grammar
+ Abstract syntax: usually a recursive Haskell datatype of syntax trees
+ Semantic type: a type of values (meanings) for the syntax
+ Semantics: a function from eval : AbsSyn -> Sem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language
** Variable scope and binding in mathematical expressions [integral, fun.def.]
** Haskell interpreter use and interp. of error messages ([[file:Live1_2022.lhs][interactive live coding]])
** Syntax trees
+ datatype of syntax trees of simple arith. expr.
** First evaluator: |eval :: E -> Int|
* (Just some empty space)





























* E1.1 learning outcomes:
** a Haskell environment up and running
** syntax trees with constructor for variables
** definition and use of |Env|
** laws, properties, and testing
* L1.2 Intro / admin
** First eval meeting (with student representatives) done
** Weekly exercises (-> bonus points for the exam)
+ https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/17542/assignments/48652
  Choose any two from
  Exc. 1.3 (Counting values),
       1,4 (Counting Maybes),
       1.8 (Composing sequences),
       1.12 (Polar complex)
  See Chapter 1 in the book.
** Exercise sessions: be prepared with questions
   2h*2 lectures = 4h/w
   2h*2 exercise sessions = 4h/w
   total 8h/w "scheduled"
   But, 7.5hp = 200h spread over 8 study weeks -> 200/8 = 25h/week "study time"
   Thus 17h left for you to schedule your own work with the course.
** *Read the book!* Chapter N = study week N
+ Not all sections are covered in lectures
+ Some sections not included in the course (marked with an *)
** Student communication: Canvas discussion forum

+ [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/17542/files/folder/LectureNotes][Files]]           = the book and other (mostly older) material
+ [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/17542/discussion_topics][Discussions]]     = a forum for student discussions and questions
+ [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/17542/announcements][Announcements]]   = where the teaching teams broadcasts messages
+ [[https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/tree/master/Exam][github/Exam]]     = all 13 old exams *with solutions*
+ [[https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/blob/master/L/SolvedExercises.md][github/SolvedEx]] = >50 solved exercises from the book
* L1.2 learning outcomes:
** Expanding a number system [N -> Z -> Q -> REAL -> Complex]
+ When equations meet types - more and more eq. can be solved.
+ [[https://jamboard.google.com/d/1BomAkVUUucA5VcAEeqZTwsX0YqahYQiOxPm4wv0ylqQ/viewer?f=0][Jamboard L1.2]]
** Active reading of mathematical text [[[file:Live2_2022.lhs][Complex number case study]]
** Modelling (different versions of) Complex in Haskell
** |eval| for complex number expressions
** The DSL of types in Haskell:
*** |type|, |newtype|, |data|
*** types and their constructors
*** |data|: choice, recursion, parameters
*** datatype of syntax trees of simple arith. expr.
*** |Nat|, |ImagUnits|, |CA|, |CB|, |CE|
** Syntax and semantics
