+ [[https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath][github]]     for the "book" (lecture notes) + code
+ [[https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/blob/master/L/01/Live1_2021.lhs][emacs]]      for live coding, etc. (org-mode)
+ [[https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/64738429538][Zoom]]       for delivering the lectures
+ [[https://jamboard.google.com/d/1LgE3Hke1KSvgU6Kdraec5ESB77ITDv44879PjDpu-9w/edit?usp=sharing][Jamboard]]   for "drawing on the whiteboard"
+ OBS studio for video recording
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf5C73P7ab-4kc8Z4S7adKdm-nTkn-ND-][YouTube]]    for video archiving
** Examination
+ Weekly exercises     -> Bonus points for the exam
+ 2 Assignments (labs) -> Pass/fail grade
+ Written Exam         -> grade U/3/4/5 (Chalmers), U/G/VG (GU)
** Reminder about spending time on the course:
+ Advice from last years' students:
  spending time on the course pays off.
  It is not enough to just focus on the labs.
+ Patrik's advice: please try to solve all the exercises in the book.
** Course evaluation: student representatives
| Prg | Namn               |

| D   | *TODO* rep. wanted |

** Learning outcomes (for the whole course, english version)
*** KU = Knowledge and Understanding
+ KU.DSL      = design and implement a DSL for a new domain
+ KU.Org      = organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
+ KU.Explain  = explain main concepts of elementary real and complex analysis, algebra, and linear algebra
*** SA = Skills and Abilities
+ SA.Notation = develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
+ SA.Calc     = perform calculational proofs
+ SA.Power    = use power series for solving differential equations
+ SA.Laplace  = use Laplace transforms for solving differential equations
*** JA = Judgement and Approach
+ JA = discuss and compare different software implementations of mathematical concepts

** First break-out rooms to start the discussion
+ brief presentation round
+ share examples of confusing notation in mathematics cmp. to programming





















* L1.1 learning outcomes:
** What is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
A DSL has four components:
+ Surface syntax (mostly ignored in this course): a set of strings defined by a grammar
+ Abstract syntax: usually a recursive Haskell datatype of syntax trees
+ Semantic type: a type of values (meanings) for the syntax
+ Semantics: a function from AbsSyn to Sem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language
** Variable scope and binding in mathematical expressions [integral, fun.def.]
** Haskell interpreter use and interp. of error messages [interactive live coding]
** Syntax trees
+ datatype of syntax trees of simple arith. expr.
** First evaluator: |eval :: E -> (String -> Int) -> Int|
* E1.1 learning outcomes:
** a Haskell environment up and running
** syntax trees with constructor for variables
** definition and use of |Env|
** laws, properties, and testing
* L1.2 Intro / admin
** First eval meeting (with student representatives) done
** Weekly exercises (bonusuppgifter)
** Exercise sessions (Ã¶vningar): be prepared with questions
   2h*2 lectures = 4h/w
   2h*2 exercise sessions = 4h/w
   total 8h/w "scheduled"
   But, 7.5hp = 200h spread over 8 study weeks -> 200/8 = 25h/week "study time"
   Thus 17h left for you to schedule your own work with the course.
** Read the book! Chapter N = study week N
** Student communication: Canvas discussion forum
** Explore the canvas page:
+ Home = Syllabus = "Kurs-pm"
+ Assignments = all deadlines and where you hand in exercises and labs
+ People = where you can find lab groups, etc.
+ Pages = useful information about different parts of the course
+ Files = the book and other (mostly older) material
+ Discussions = a forum for student discussions and questions
+ Announcements = where the teaching teams broadcasts messages




* L1.2 learning outcomes:
** Expanding a number system [N -> Z -> Q -> REAL -> Complex]
+ When equations meet types - more and more eq. can be solved.
** Active reading of mathematical text [Complex number case study]
** Modelling (different versions of) Complex in Haskell
** The DSL of types in Haskell:
*** |type|, |newtype|, |data|
*** types and their constructors
*** |data|: choice, recursion, parameters
*** datatype of syntax trees of simple arith. expr.
*** |Nat|, |ImagUnits|, |CA|, |CB|, |CE|
** Syntax and semantics
** |eval| for complex number expressions

* E1.2 learning outcomes:
** syntax trees for |ComplexSyn r|, the "complex numbers extension" of a type |r|
** more use of |Env| and |lookup|
** more on pattern matching: deep patterns (in |simplifyStep|)
** more laws, properties, and testing
** TODO: |Maybe|, |Either|
* Notation for this file:
** L1.1 means week 1, lecture 1 (Tuesday)
** L1.2 means week 1, lecture 2 (Thursday)
** E1.1 means week 1, exercise session 1 (the presentation / live coding part)
** E1.2 means week 1, exercise session 2 (the presentation / live coding part)
** The format of the file is Emacs Org-mode
