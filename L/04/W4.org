** Soon back to campus teaching
+ The Swedish Government has decided to remove most pandemic
  restrictions by 2022-02-09.
+ The DSLsofMath course will be back on campus from 2022-02-14.
** more Q&A time
+ Based on feedback from the student representatives during the
  mid-course evaluation meeting we have decided to increase the
  available time for "Q&A" by converting most lecture slots into
  opportunities to ask questions and get answers from the lecturer.
+ [Exceptions: Week 7 where Nicola Botta will give the lectures and
  Week 8 when the lecturer is on vacation.]
+ Concretely, the Tuesday lecture will be a "Q&A session" on the
  regular zoom link.
+ Starting 2022-02-14 the "Q&A sessions" will be on campus in the
  rooms according to TimeEdit.
** video lectures remain, but will be pre-recorded.
+ The lectures will instead be uploaded before the "lecture slots" in
  the schedule and you are expected to watch them before coming to the
  Q&A.
+ For each lecture, *watch it before the scheduled slot* to make the
  most of the Q&A session.
** Exam aids and preparation
+ I got a student question about the aids allowed on the exam.
+ You can bring "One textbook of your choice" to the exam.
+ You probably want to choose the course book (but you are allowed to
  instead bring, say, Beta - Mathematics Handbook, or Adams and Essex,
  etc. instead if you like).
+ If you plan to bring the course-book it is a good idea to get hold
  of it now so that you have time to get to know it.
+ The github repo contains all 13 old exams with solution suggestions
  so that you can prepare in your own time.
+ PS. You are not allowed to bring other notes, or a calculator, to
  the exam.
** Reminder: schedule change (just tomorrow): Exc. session at 10.00
+ Thus the Bonus hand-in deadline is also earlier: 09.50
** A2 info (new groups coming) [deadline 2022-03-01]
+ Now it is time to start looking at assignment 2 which is done in
  [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/17542/groups#tab-9713][new groups]]: group set "Assignment 2".
+ The first step is to get in touch with your group-mates - I will
  provide break-out rooms and can answer questions during the Thursday
  lecture slot.
+ The second step (deadline on Monday the 14:th) is to fill in a
  little Quiz just to see that you have got the group collaboration
  started. (I suggest you fill it in tomorrow after meeting in the
  zoom room.)
+ The third step is the actual work on the assignment - good luck!
+ (PS. Sorry for the confusion caused by last year's quiz being copied
  to the wrong date.)
