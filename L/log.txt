2021-12-25: Duplicate limit of sequence

p18: 1.3: limit from wikpedia
  1. binding syntax, typing series ans function from Nat
  2. partial function - use Maybe in return type
     (not all sequences have a limit)

p72: 2.5.1: limit from Adams and Essex
  sequence is a function
  typing a : Nat -> REAL
  predicate haslim

2019-01-19: Debugging spacing

I'd like the spacing before and after a code block to be the
same. Currently it seems like the space below is sometimes larger.
After some searching I found that the environment plainhscode is used
for the code blocks:

\newenvironment{plainhscode}%
  {\hsnewpar\abovedisplayskip
   \advance\leftskip\mathindent
   \hscodestyle
   \let\hspre\(\let\hspost\)%
   \pboxed}%
  {\endpboxed%
   \hsnewpar\belowdisplayskip
   \ignorespacesafterend}

But the lengths
  \the\abovedisplayskip
  \the\belowdisplayskip
are both the same: 8.5pt plus 3.0pt minus 4.0pt

Then perhaps there is an additional "skip" after the code?

Yes - that turns out to be the case if there is a "new paragraph"
after the code. In my particular test case ("which converts integers
to the actual type |a|." in Chapter 3) there was a paragraph break
which I removed and thus fixed the spacing.

I'll make a quick search for other cases.
