                  of {Haskell} programs},
  shorttitle =	 {{QuickCheck}},
  abstract =	 {Quick Check is a tool which aids the Haskell
                  programmer in formulating and testing properties of
                  programs. Properties are described as Haskell
                  functions, and can be automatically tested on random
                  input, but it is also possible to define custom test
                  data generators. We present a number of case
                  studies, in which the tool was successfully used,
                  and also point out some pitfalls to avoid. Random
                  testing is especially suitable for functional
                  programs because properties can be stated at a fine
                  grain. When a function is built from separately
                  tested components, then random testing suffices to
                  obtain good coverage of the definition under test.},
