Week 5: Polynomials and Power Series
* Recap of homomorphisms (also on Jamboard)
** H2
Homomorphism2(h,opA,opB) = forall x, y. h (opA x y) == opB (h x) (h y)
  where  h   :: A -> B
         opA :: A -> A -> A
         opB :: B -> B -> B
** H1
Homomorphism1(h,opA,opB) =      forall x. h (opA x) == opB (h x)
  where  h   :: A -> B
         opA :: A -> A
         opB :: B -> B
** H0
Homomorphism0(h,opA,opB) =                    h opA == opB
  where  h   :: A -> B
         opA :: A
         opB :: B
** Examples:

Homomorphism2(eval,Add,(+)) = forall x, y. eval(Add x y) == (eval x)+(eval y)
  where  eval  :: FunExp -> FunSem
         Add   :: FunExp -> FunExp -> FunExp
         (+)   :: FunSem -> FunSem -> FunSem

Homomorphism1(eval,Exp,exp) = forall e. eval(Exp e) == exp (eval e)
  where  eval  :: FunExp -> FunSem
         Exp   :: FunExp -> FunExp
         exp   :: FunSem -> FunSem

** Homomorphism between structures: Monoid
  "h is a monoid homomorphism"
={def}
  H2(h,opA,opB) & H0(h,unitA,unitB)
** Homomorphism between structures: Syntax to Semantics
Given
  data Syn where
    Foo  :: Syn -> Syn -> Syn
    Bar  :: Syn -> Syn
    Leaf :: Syn
the predicate "h is a homomorphism from Syn to Sem" means
there exist functions
    foo  :: Sem -> Sem -> Sem
    bar  :: Sem -> Sem
    leaf :: Sem
such that
  H2(h, Foo, foo) & H1(h, Bar, bar) & H0(h, Leaf, leaf)

Note that the last line is fulfilled by h = eval where
  eval (Foo x y) = foo (eval x) (eval y)
  eval (Bar x)   = bar (eval x)
  eval Leaf      = leaf

* Homomorphism examples related to A2 (Apply.hs)
** apply   :: a -> (a->b) -> b
** applyFD :: a -> FD a -> Bi a
* Polynomials (Jamboard)

\begin{quote}
P is a polynomial function if

  P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n - 1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0

where $a_n$, $a_{n-1}$, \ldots, $a_1$, and $a_0$, called the
\textbf{coefficients} of the polymonial [misspelled in the book], are
constants and, if $n > 0$, then $a_n â‰  0$.
%
The number $n$, the degree of the highest power of $x$ in the
polynomial, is called the \textbf{degree} of the polynomial.
%
(The degree of the zero polynomial is not defined.)

* Power Series
** Polynomial degree

** degree as "almost a homomorphism"
** lifting to Maybe

** derivative

** integration
** Polynomial division with remainder
** Power series example: 1/(1-x)
