P is a polynomial function if

  P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n - 1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0

where $a_n$, $a_{n-1}$, \ldots, $a_1$, and $a_0$, called the
\textbf{coefficients} of the polymonial [misspelled in the book], are
constants and, if $n > 0$, then $a_n â‰  0$.
%
The number $n$, the degree of the highest power of $x$ in the
polynomial, is called the \textbf{degree} of the polynomial.
%
(The degree of the zero polynomial is not defined.)
