\section{Recap of syntax trees with variables, |Env| and |lookup|}

This was frequently a source of confusion already the first week so
there is already a question + answers earlier in this text.
%
But here is an additional example to help clarify the matter.
%
\begin{code}
data Rat v = RV v | FromI Integer | RPlus (Rat v) (Rat v) | RDiv (Rat v) (Rat v)
  deriving (Eq, Show)

newtype RatSem = RSem (Integer, Integer)
\end{code}
%
We have a type |Rat v| for the syntax trees of rational number
expressions (with variables of type |v|) and a type |RatSem| for the
semantics of those rational number expressions as pairs of integers.
%
The constructor |RV :: v -> Rat v| is used to embed variables with
names of type |v| in |Rat v|.
%
We could use |String| instead of |v| but with a type parameter |v| we
get more flexibility at the same time as we get better feedback from
the type-checker.
%
Note that this type parameter serves a different purpose from the type
parameter in~\cref{sec:toComplexSyn}.

%
To evaluate some |e :: Rat v| we need to know how to evaluate the
variables we encounter.
%
What does ``evaluate'' mean for a variable?
%
Well, it just means that we must be able to translate a variable name
(of type |v|) to a semantic value (a rational number in this case).
%
To ``translate a name to a value'' we can use a function (of type |v
-> RatSem|) so we can give the following implementation of the
evaluator:
%
\begin{code}
evalRat1 ::  (v -> RatSem) -> (Rat v -> RatSem)
evalRat1 ev (RV v)       = ev v
evalRat1 ev (FromI i)    = fromISem i
evalRat1 ev (RPlus l r)  = plusSem  (evalRat1 ev l) (evalRat1 ev r)
evalRat1 ev (RDiv  l r)  = divSem   (evalRat1 ev l) (evalRat1 ev r)
\end{code}
Notice that we simply added a parameter |ev| for ``evaluate variable''
to the evaluator.
%
The rest of the definition follows a common pattern: recursively
translate each subexpression and apply the corresponding semantic
operation to combine the results: |RPlus| is replaced by |plusSem|,
etc.
%
\begin{code}
fromISem :: Integer -> RatSem
fromISem i = RSem (i, 1)

plusSem :: RatSem -> RatSem -> RatSem
plusSem = undefined -- TODO: exercise

-- Division of rational numbers
divSem :: RatSem -> RatSem -> RatSem
divSem (RSem (a, b)) (RSem (c, d)) = RSem (a*d, b*c)
\end{code}

Often the first argument |ev| to the eval function is constructed from
a list of pairs:
%
\begin{code}
type Env v s = [(v, s)]

envToFun :: (Show v, Eq v) => Env v s -> (v -> s)
envToFun [] v = error ("envToFun: variable "++ show v ++" not found")
envToFun ((w,s):env) v
  | w == v     = s
  | otherwise  = envToFun env v
\end{code}
%
Thus, |Env v s| can be seen as an implementation of a ``lookup
table''.
%
It could also be implemented using hash tables or binary search trees,
but efficiency is not the point here.
%
Finally, with |envToFun| in our hands we can implement a second
version of the evaluator:
%
\begin{code}
evalRat2 :: (Show v, Eq v) => (Env v RatSem) -> (Rat v -> RatSem)
evalRat2 env e = evalRat1 (envToFun env) e
\end{code}
