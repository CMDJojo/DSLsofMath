Learning outcomes:

* Power Series and Maclaurin series: [[https://jamboard.google.com/d/1zGY5BkfjDTihEhob8QWbcSvSf2dKXok6XxSyfe18A6E/viewer?f=0][Jamboard L6.1]]
** definitions of deriv and integ (last week)
** transformation from semantics (ODE) to syntax (coefficient equations)
+ f x = f 0 + \int_0^x f'   -- semantics
+ fs = integ (f 0) fs'      -- syntax, with f = eval fs
** solving differential equations "by hand"
+ expx,
+ sinx, cosx
  si = [0,  1,  0  ,-1/6, 0   , ...]
  co = [1,  0, -1/2,  0 , 1/24, ...]
** Maclaurin series
+ (Maclaurin series = Taylor series at the point zero)

Big picture: a transformation in three stages

  f
-> compute all derivatives
  [f, f', f'', ...]
-> apply 0
  [f 0, f' 0, f'' 0, ...]
-> divide by factorials
  [f 0/0!, f' 0/1!, f'' 0/2!, ...]

In the lecture we worked through the different steps with examples and motivation / explanation.
* Live coding DS = Derivative Stream: a stream of all derivatives
See file:Live_6_1_2022.lhs for Ring instances
* Live coding L6.2 (file:Live_6_1_2022.lhs)
+ DS instances for MulGroup and Transcendental
