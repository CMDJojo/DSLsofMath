  abstract =	 {The main idea behind this book is to encourage
                  readers to approach mathematical domains from a
                  functional programming perspective: to identify the
                  main functions and types involved and, when
                  necessary, to introduce new abstractions; to give
                  calculational proofs; to pay attention to the syntax
                  of the mathematical expressions; and, finally, to
                  organize the resulting functions and types in
                  domain-specific languages.  The book is recommended
                  for developers who are learning mathematics and
                  would like to use Haskell to make sense of
                  definitions and theorems. It is also a book for the
                  mathematically interested who wants to explore
                  functional programming and domain-specific
                  languages. The book helps put into perspective the
                  domains of Mathematics and Functional Programming
                  and shows how Computer Science and Mathematics are
                  usefully taught together.}
